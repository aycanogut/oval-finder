### About The Project

It's a multi-paged job-searching platform website.
I learnt mobile-first design, component-based Modular CSS, reusability of page elements and layouts, the Bootstrap grid system, a deeper understanding of semantic HTML elements, responsive web design, and had experience working with multiple pages.
