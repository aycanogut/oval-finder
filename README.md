### About The Project

It's a job searching platform website with multiple pages. I learned mobile-first design, Semantic HTML, component based Modular CSS, re-usability of page elements and layouts, Bootstrap grid system, a better grasp usage of semantic HTML elements, responsive web design and had experience working with multiple pages. Still on development.
